Should get you like 80% of the way there
- Task
	- What do you want to do
	- Add persona - act as an...
	- Format of output - organize that data into a table...
- Context
	- Rule of them, the more context the better 
- References
	- Give examples to the AI, e.g. past completed tasks
- Evaluate
	- See if it's what you want
- Iterate
	- Refine for the results you want

# The 4 iteration methods
- Revisit the prompting framework, give more of the things missing from framework
- Split content into smaller sentences - similar to a conversation
	- Split prompt into simpler sentences
- Trying different phrasing or switching to an analogous task
	- e.g. instead of create a marketing plan for... task could be write a story about how this product fits into the lives of our target customer demographics
- Introduce constraints


# Interact with different modalities
- code, images, pictures
